Huuto.net (which is pretty much finnish E b a y) is not that much fun to browse mobilely at least with slow connection. 
This version makes away with some mostly unneeded features and styles and uses public Huuto.net API with javascript.
It
* is responsive
* has really light footprint (8,6kB gzipped) 
* allows to save favorite searches

Default search lists items according to closing time.

Test here!
